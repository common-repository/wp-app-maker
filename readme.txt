2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why I have to register? =
Registration is needed in order to prevent spam/abuses against our build services and to generate your own app ID, which is a secret key needed to synch your admin console and your app with our services.  

= How do I distribute my app? =
You can choose to directly distribute your app (by using our download link) or to release it on the Android Market.
The main difference between these two options is that, in order to install an app from outside the Market, the Android device needs to enable the "Unknown Sources" option.
Don't forget that the plugin also provides a Sidebar Widget, which makes you able to quickly distribute your app by using a QR Code.

= How is my app generated? =
Your app is remotely generated by our cloud services which automatically notify the plugin admin page when it is available or when a build is in progress. 

= I can't see any content inside my app! =
When you install and activate the plugin, your blog will start providing your articles to the app by using a special xml based data transfer protocol.
This means that, in order to make the app working fine, you should make sure that: the plugin is enabled, your blog has its own domain and IP Address (a locally installed blog won't work!) and
your server doesn't strip additional GET parameters added to the URL.

= Can I remove the plugin after generating my app? =
Absolutely not! The plugin must be always enabled because it also acts as a datasource for your app.

= Why I can't see the featured posts slider? =
Make sure to have upgraded the plugin (this feature has been introduced since version 1.0.16) and to have reinstalled the app on your device (if you were using a previous version).
If the slider still doesn't appear, make also sure you correctly configured the slider images: 
* If you are using WordPress version 2.9 and above: Just set "Post Thumbnail" when adding new post for the posts in selected category above. 
* If you are using WordPress version under 2.9 you have to add custom fields in each post on the category you set as featured category. The custom field should be named "app-maker-featured" and it's value should be full image URL.
